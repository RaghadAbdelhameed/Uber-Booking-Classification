# Uber-Booking-Prediction
This repository hosts a project focused on a systematic comparison of various machine learning models to solve a multi-class classification problem. The task is to predict the final outcome of an Uber booking from a set of five distinct categories: 'Completed', 'Cancelled by Driver', 'Cancelled by Customer', 'No Driver Found', and 'Incomplete'.
